<h1 id="activity-log">Activity Log</h1>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>I completed the <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/161">LPI Linux Essentials course</a>, found on Linux Academy.  This course takes you through the basics of Linux, including a background in the history of Linux as well as several of the different commonly used distributions.  It also covers security concepts and the components of a Linux system.</p>
<p>I already had a good grounding in Ubuntu, but it was helpful for me to be exposed to some of the differences between Ubuntu and Debian.</p>
<h2 id="course-notes">Course Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>This course could have been better, in that it was difficult to follow along with the videos.  The videos are mostly standalone, without content that you can do on your own setup.</li>
<li>Watch the videos at as fast a speed as you can process and you’ll get more done faster. Especially the first few videos that don’t convey much substantive information, but more information about the class, I was able to watch at 1.75x and get through pretty quickly.</li>
<li>Installing CentOS on VirtualBox
<ul>
<li>I was unable to get my mouse working within CentOS during the installation process. However, I was able to complete the installation by using keyboard commands (tab, spacebar, enter, esc). Oddly enough, my scroll wheel worked, but no mouse pointer showed up anywhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixing the Mouse
<ul>
<li>Mouse initially appeared to not function on the guest OS, even when I tried to attach it by going to Devices-&gt;USB Wireless Mouse</li>
<li>As it turned out, the mouse was invisible. This is likely do to my using a SURFACE PRO. The fix:
<ul>
<li>Shutdown the guest OS</li>
<li>Download and install the VirtualBox Extension Pack: (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a>)</li>
<li>With the guest OS shut off, go to Settings-&gt;System&gt;Motherboard Tab, then click the dropdown for Pointing Device and set it to “USB Multi-Touch Tablet”.</li>
<li>Power on the Guest OS. On the Guest OS window, click Input-&gt;Enable Mouse Pointer Integration</li>
<li>Mouse should now be visible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
