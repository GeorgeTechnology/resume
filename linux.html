<ul>
<li>Watch the videos at as fast a speed as you can process and you’ll get more done faster. Especially the first few videos that don’t convey much substantive information, but more information about the class, I was able to watch at 1.75x and get through pretty quickly.</li>
<li>Installing CentOS on VirtualBox
<ul>
<li>I was unable to get my mouse working within CentOS during the installation process. However, I was able to complete the installation by using keyboard commands (tab, spacebar, enter, esc). Oddly enough, my scroll wheel worked, but no mouse pointer showed up anywhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixing the Mouse
<ul>
<li>Mouse initially appeared to not function on the guest OS, even when I tried to attach it by going to Devices-&gt;USB Wireless Mouse</li>
<li>Turned out the mouse was invisible. This is likely do to my using a SURFACE PRO. The fix:
<ul>
<li>Shutdown the guest OS</li>
<li>Download and install the VirtualBox Extension Pack: (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a>)</li>
<li>With the guest OS shut off, go to Settings-&gt;System&gt;Motherboard Tab, then click the dropdown for Pointing Device and set it to “USB Multi-Touch Tablet”.</li>
<li>Power on the Guest OS. On the Guest OS window, click Input-&gt;Enable Mouse Pointer Integration</li>
<li>Mouse should now be visible.</li>
</ul>
