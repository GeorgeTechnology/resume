<p><a href="https://youtu.be/lg5OaacTRDg">Click here</a> to see a video walkthrough of the PowerBI dashboard I created, based on the data downloaded for free from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/sample-datasets#the-power-bi-samples-as-excel-files">Microsoft</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Watch the videos at as fast a speed as you can stand.  The real learning comes from doing the labs - do not skip them.</li>
<li>The videos themselves do not require participation.  You can listen to them in the car just to get the idea of what’s possible with PowerBI.  Again, the real learning comes from the labs.</li>
<li>If you are auditing the course, you may not be able to get all the green check marks to show up saying that you have completed the content.  Many of the tasks (such as quizzes) are blocked from showing up on the audit track, and prevent the system from registering that you completed that chapter.</li>
<li>Creating the online dashboard is difficult solely because, as an outsider to a fictitious company, you have no idea what questions are insightful, or what that company would want to know.  Spend a significant amount of time</li>
<li>The most vital section for building the dashboard is Section 3: Power BI Desktop Visualization.  I had to watch a few of these videos several times.</li>
<li>Creating a chart that lets you drill down by clicking through items:
<ul>
<li>Find the first item you want to display in the chart.</li>
<li>Click the ellipses (…) next to that item, select “New Hierarchy”</li>
<li>Find the next item <strong>in the same table</strong> you want included in the drilldown. (This does not work across tables that I could find.)</li>
<li>Click the ellipses (…) next to that item, select “Add to Hierarchy.”  Add it to your previously created Hierarchy.</li>
<li>Repeat this as much as necessary.</li>
<li>Once the full hierarchy is created, add the entire hierarchy to the chart.  You will now be able to click through each level, drilling down through data in the same graphic within your live report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-powerbi">What is PowerBI?</h3>
<p><a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">PowerBI</a> is an incredibly useful business analytics tool that performs powerful meta analysis on the data given to it.  This analysis lets businesses visualize data in a series of highly impactful graphics, charts, and tables, and much more importantly, share them across the organization, or even embed them in their own website or software.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-it-useful-to-me">How is it useful to me?</h3>
<p>A subject matter expert is often put in the position of needing to explain highly complex data to high level officers in a company - officers who are unfamiliar with the data and don’t have time to sit through hours and hours of context necessary to understand the point which the subject matter expert wishes to make.  PowerBI allows that expert to put this information in easy to understand, up-to-date infographics that help make a point, rather than detract from it.</p>
<p>In my personal career, I will be able to use PowerBI to easily find answers to complex questions, so long as I have access to the data.  Questions such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What attributes of our customers correlate with highest spend?"<br>
“What attributes of a product correlate with the fastest inventory turns?”<br>
“Which supervisors lead teams most frequently meet their sales goals?  Is there a correlation between positive subordinate reviews of those supervisors and meeting sales goals?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ability to quickly discern the answer to these and other questions, and provide the answers in an easily understandable format, will prove vital to my career.</p>
<h3 id="what-sort-of-information-did-i-learn">What sort of information did I learn?</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT207x+1T2019a/course/">edX PowerBI course</a> gives a basic grounding in the use of PowerBI.  After completing the course, a student will be familiar with loading data (via file or database connection), configuring relational database connections, and creating custom measures for use in live, online dashboards.  The course also covers PowerBI’s API and integration capabilities.</p>
<p>Specifically, the course topics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power BI Desktop Data Transformations</li>
<li>Power BI Desktop Modelling</li>
<li>Power BI Desktop Visualization</li>
<li>Power BI Service</li>
<li>Working with Excel</li>
<li>Direct Connectivity</li>
<li>Developer API</li>
<li>Mobile App</li>
</ul>
