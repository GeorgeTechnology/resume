<h3 id="what-is-aws">What is AWS?</h3>
<p>I completed the <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/amazon-web-services/training/course/name/aws-essentials-new">AWS Essentials</a> course on Linux Academy. Amazon Web Services is the premier cloud computing platform in the United States.  It hosts data and services for businesses as large as GE and as small as that Etsy person you had design your 3D printed tea cozy.</p>
<p>AWS is a secure platform that offers database storage, extra computing power, and other functionality that allows businesses to quickly and easily scale their computing infrastructure without expensive hardware rebuilds.  It provides a wide array of services, from virtual computers to high capacity storage, web hosting to database management.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-this-useful-to-me">How is this useful to me?</h3>
<p>Because AWS is the premier cloud hosting platform in the US, it is highly likely that I will work at or work with a company that runs on Amazon infrastructure.  As a corporate counsel intern, I have already had to review contracts for the purchase of Amazon Web Services, and even a partner agreement for the reselling and support of managed cloud services through AWS.</p>
<p>Although these agreements exhibit many classic elements of corporate contracts, the terms quickly travel beyond the knowledge of an average tech-illiterate attorney.  These agreements contain many terms related to the use of the web portal, the requirements for configuring administrator access for a client, and the management of a client’s infrastructure to Amazon’s exact specifications.  Because of this training, I have a better understanding of what goes in to each of these requirements, and will be more fluent in this topic when discussing these terms with the engineers who will have to actually implement these requirements.</p>
<p>Additionally, if I were to “hang a shingle” (start my own law firm), I very well might use AWS to host my own firm’s infrastructure.   Law firms are notoriously poor at managing technical infrastructure, yet they have incredibly valuable client data stored on their systems.  I could use AWS to obtain security levels much higher than I could otherwise achieve on my own as a small business - data encryption at rest and in-transit, compliance with PCI and government regulations, and more.</p>
