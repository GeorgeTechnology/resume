<h3 id="what-did-i-learn">What did I learn?</h3>
<p>As the first task in my technical skills course, I completed 12 different GitHub Learning Labs courses.  These labs provided an introduction to the fundamental use of GitHub, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The basics of distributed version control, including creating, reviewing, and approving pull requests</li>
<li>A core level of bug tracking, documentation, and source code management throughout the development process</li>
<li>The use of HTML and markdown in GitHub</li>
<li>Publishing webpages through GitHub Pages</li>
</ul>
<p>And many other skills.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-that-useful-to-me">How is that useful to me?</h3>
<p>My target career is as an attorney in the cybersecurity/privacy industry.  Although I won’t be developing code on my own, a personal understanding of the process used by developers to generate and moderate code will be key to being able to fluently communicate with other departments in my organization.</p>
<p>By better communicating with the technical team, I will be able to will draft better contracts, better manage employee agreements, and better protect a company’s intellectual property, among other things.</p>
