    What is Controlled Unclassified Information?
</h1>
<p>
    a. <u>Summary</u> <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    i. CUI is any safeguarded or controlled information created or processed by
    or on behalf of the executive branch of government or its agencies. All CUI
    should be protected following
    <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-1/final">
        NIST 800-171
    </a>
    (CUI Basic), but some agencies, such as the Department of Defense, have
    additional agency specific regulations on top of the basic provisions (CUI
    Specified). (For a list of CUI sources, see
    <a href="https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/category-list">
        The CUI Registry
    </a>
    .)<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    b. <u>Statutory </u><u>Definition</u>
    <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2017-title32-vol6/pdf/CFR-2017-title32-vol6-part2002.pdf"
    >
        32 C.F.R. &#167; 2002.4(h)
    </a>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    i. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is information the Government
    creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on
    behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy
    requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination
    controls.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    ii. CUI does not include classified or information a non-executive branch
    entity possesses and maintains in its own systems that did not come from,
    or was not created or possessed by or for, an executive branch agency or an
    entity acting for an agency. Law, regulation, or Government-wide policy may
    require or permit safeguarding or dissemination controls<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Requiring or permitting agencies to control or protect the information
but providing no specific controls, which makes the information CUI Basic;    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    2. requiring or permitting agencies to control or protect the information
    and providing specific controls for doing so, which makes the information
    CUI Specified; or <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    3. requiring or permitting agencies to control the information and
    specifying only some of those controls, which makes the information CUI
    Specified, but with CUI Basic controls where the authority does not
    specify.<strong></strong>
</p>
<h1>
    How do I know if my business area or physical location is covered by CUI
    regulations?
</h1>
<p>
    &#183; If it works on a US federal contract or is a supplier on a US
    federal contract, then it is probably covered.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>How do I identify CUI?</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    i. <strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The government will mark any CUI it gives you with designations from the
    <a
        href="https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf"
    >
        CUI Marking Handbook
    </a>
    . This can come in the form of physical documents, electronic files,
    emails, or any other kind of information. However, you may also generate
    CUI during your work for the government. Your contract should clearly
    define what CUI you produce and how it should be protected. Make sure this
is clearly stated during contract negotiations with the government.    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    ii. <strong>CUI Basic</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. All unclassified information throughout the executive branch that
    requires any kind of safeguarding or dissemination control is CUI. This
    includes information provided by the government as well as information
    generated by the contractor.
</p>
<p>
    2. <u>Government Provided Information</u>
</p>
<p>
    &#183; Any CUI provided by the government must be labeled with CUI or
    agency-specific designations.
    <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2017-title32-vol6/pdf/CFR-2017-title32-vol6-part2002.pdf"
    >
        32 C.F.R. &#167; 2002.16(3)
    </a>
    (For instance: Unclassified (U), For Official Use Only (U//FOUO), Official
    Use Only (OUO), Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU).) For a full list of
    markings, see the
    <a
        href="https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf"
    >
        CUI Marking Handbook
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    3. <u>Contractor Generated Information</u>
</p>
<p>
    &#183; The individual contractor agreement with the government entity
    should describe what contractor generated data is and is not CUI.
    <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2016-21665/p-26">
        Comments in the Federal Register
    </a>
    indicate that the CUI regulation (32 C.F.R. &#167; 2002) was not intended
    to draw a line defining what Contractor Generated Information is CUI, but
    rather intended to leave that to contracting practices, and to later
    additions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This area will be
    handled in an upcoming
    <a
        href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201704&amp;RIN=9000-AN56"
    >
        FAR case 2017-016
    </a>
    . As of May 2019, the case was still in the proposal stage, not yet
    drafted. Will be written by the Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council and
    the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    iii. <strong>CUI Specified</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. There are many agencies which have agency-specific regulations
    surrounding CUI. If an agency&#8217;s CUI is CUI Specified, that should be
    flagged during the contract negotiation with the agency. A good example of
CUI Specified is any work done with the Department of Defense, or DoD:    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Defense Projects</strong>
</p>
<p>
    a. <strong>Covered Defense Information (CDI) -</strong> If the site has
    information related to a Defense Project, that is probably &#8220;Covered
    Defense Information&#8221; (CDI), which is protected both as CUI and as CDI
    (CUI Specified). This information includes:
</p>
<p>
    &#183; Information provided by or on behalf of the DoD that is marked as
    CUI or identified as CUI in the contract/order.
</p>
<p>
    &#183; Any information created, used, transmitted, or stored by the
    contractor in order to complete the contract/order.
    <a

    >
        DFAR 252.204-7012
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    b. <strong>Who is responsible for identifying CDI? </strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Information given to contractors</u>
        &#8211;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The entity generating the document is responsible for identifying any CDI
    or CUI it provides to the contractor. It should be clearly marked, using
    appropriate CUI markings.
    <a
        href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/520001-V4p.PDF?ver=2018-05-09-115318-927"

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Information generated by contractors</u>
        &#8211;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The contract between the contractor and the DoD should describe how to
    identify CDI or CUI generated by the contractor, as well as the necessary
    controls or protections that should be used to protect it.
    <a
        href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/520001-V4p.PDF?ver=2018-05-09-115318-927"

    HOW IT MUST BE PROTECTED.

</ul>
<p>
    2. <strong>Is the CUI contained and Isolated</strong>?
</p>
<p>
    a. <strong>Yes:</strong> controls need only be applied to the areas where
    CUI is contained.
</p>
<p>
    b. N<strong>o:</strong> controls will need to be applied wherever CUI
    exists. CUI will either need to be consolidated, or NIST 800-171 controls
    will need to be applied to all systems containing CUI, up to the entire IT
    infrastructure if the CUI is that widespread.
</p>
<p>
    c. <strong>How do I contain CUI?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are several different levels of isolation, depending on your needs.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Item Level</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    &#183; If only a few pieces of information exist in a system or location,
    securing those items in one place makes the most sense.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Project Level</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    &#183; If your business or location deals only with one federal project,
    creating a physical and logical container for that project (such as a room
    and a sequestered server or network) within your facility, network, and
    systems makes the most sense. All content related to that project can then
    live in these protected systems.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Location Level</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    &#183; If your business or location deals with multiple federal projects,
    multiple types of CUI, or has multiple employees working on different
    projects, it may make the most sense to set aside an entire building or
    floor &#8211; and accompanying network, workstations, servers, and
    periphery systems &#8211; for CUI work. This entire area should meet CUI
    Basic standards. Projects working with CUI Specified can then be
    sequestered at the project level.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>b. </strong>
    <strong>Is the CUI actually controlled?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &#183; Any system containing CUI must be secure, monitored, and audited.
    Risk assessments of Physical location, network, authentication, and
    infrastructure must be done to ensure CUI only accessible to authorized
    individuals.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>c. </strong>
    <strong>Does the site employ best practices?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &#183; Even outside of CUI system controls, what are the wider policies at
    the site? Do they employ best practices? (regular backups and security
    updates, system and network auditing, etc.)
